## Project Description/Abstract:
Our project proposal will be an application-oriented problem focusing on the well
known task of “Short-term Price Prediction of Stocks” using time series data of stock price.
Since this is a hard problem, we want to be able to predict whether the stock increases or
decreases in value over n number of days, and try to match the prediction with the actual rate.

## Motivation:
While the stock market price predictor is a common type of problem, our primary
motivation for doing this problem is to gain experience using time series data in the training of
recurrent neural networks to implement a generalized predictive model. This problem is a
difficult one with many possible variables. Aspects such as physical factors, social perception,
and behavior combine to make share prices volatile and they are very difficult to predict with a
high degree of accuracy.

## Background:
There is quite a bit of information about solving this problem, as it has a lot of
applications in terms of anomaly detection and fraud prevention, as well as personal private
investment strategy tuning. This can and has been solved with regression, moving averages,
multivariate Bayesian time series (BSTS), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), K Nearest
neighbors, multilayer perceptrons, and other methods. We will be investigating LSTM,
regression, and possibly BSTS, if time permits.


## Data sets:
https://www.quandl.com/ - An free API with real time data incorporated into
NASDAQ.
https://www.quantopian.com/ - A crowd-sourced quantitative investment
firm with an open dataset and API.
https://data.worldbank.org/ - Graph, map and compare more than 1,000 time
series indicators from the World Development Indicators.
https://www.google.com/finance - a financial information site that is
unmonetized and provided by Google.
https://www.alphavantage.co/ - An API with real time and historical data.

## Task Division:
We will divide the tasks of data wrangling, model implementation, parameter tuning,
and documentation, and presentation between all members equally. Each member of the
team will be involved with all parts of the project and collaborate to complete each task. All
members will also be responsible for independently running the models on their own
machines in order to learn and understand how to implement solutions to the problem in
greater depth.
